# Script to create new jekyll blog

## Purpose
Whenever I wanted to write a blog I'd have to duplicate one of the old blog files and edit the contents to get started. I wanted a quick way to do it, so I wrote the script.

## Installation
Copy the contents from the ```new_blog.sh``` file and paste it under the contents of your local ```.zshrc```(or ```.bashrc```) file.
If you can't find your .zshrc file, ask google.

## Command
Create a blog with {title}: ```new_blog [title of the blog]```

Example: ```new_blog How to procrastinate effectively```

## Customization

If you want to customize the contents that gets filled into the file, edit the ```content``` value in the script as you like.
