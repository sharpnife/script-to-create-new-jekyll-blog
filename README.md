# Script to create new jekyll blog

## Purpose
Whenever I wanted to write a blog I'd have to duplicate one of the old blog files and edit the contents to get started. I wanted a quick way to do it, so I wrote the script.

## Install
Copy the contents from the ```new_blog.sh``` file and paste under all the contents of your local ```.zshrc```(or ```.bashrc```) file.
If you can't find your .zshrc file, ask google.
